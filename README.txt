Here you will find data and code (MATLAB) used to reproduce analysis and figures of 
Henderikx-Freitas, F., Allen, J.A., Lansdorp, B.M., and White, A.E. "Diel variations in the estimated refractive index of bulk oceanic particles", Optics Express TBD(TBD) (2022).

Content:
Data and code are separated into the following folders:

mfiles: this folder contains all matlab functions used to process data, perform analysis, save outputs, and make figures that appear in the manuscript. Function "MAIN.m" calls ALL sub-functions, and running this single MAIN.m function should reproduce all analysis from the paper.

data: this folder contains minimally processed beam attenuation (from a C-Star instrument, 660 nm), particle backscattering (from an ECO sensor, 700 nm), IFCB (Imaging FlowCytobot), and LISST (Laser In Situ Scattering and Transmissometry, 670 nm) data. LISST data are found in a sub-folder.

proc: this folder contain all processed .mat files generated by the subfunctions in folders mfiles. 
matfiles of interest might include: 
cp_bbp_hourly.mat: hourly averaged surface beam attenuation data (from CleanupIOPs.m)
ifcb_IntegratedHourly.mat: Hourly particle size distributions and volume concentrations from the IFCB (from Get_HourlyIntegrated_PSD_IFCB.m)
n_slope457_NoAvg.mat: estimated indices of refraction (660 nm) assuming IFCB PSD for particles > 5.54 micron, and extrapolated portion of the PSD assuming a power slope of 4.57 (from run2a.m).
n_slope457_NoAvg_LISST.mat: estimated indices of refraction (670 nm) when LISST data angle #26 are used in the inversion instead of beam attenuation data. See Appendix of paper (see MAIN.m section "APPENDIX analysis").
hourly_data_overview.xlsx: An excel spreadsheet containing the basic datasets and outputs, including time, latitude, longitude, processed particulate beam attenuation coefficients (binned hourly), binned particle size distributions used in the main analysis of the paper, as well as corresponding indices of refraction estimated in the paper are available.

figures: this folder contains all figures generated when running MAIN.m
